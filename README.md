# DGPVisualization
Visualize the data generating process and calcuate the fitted OLS estimates.

This program initially works for the lecture on Basic Econometrics. I want to show the students how the data is generated and why OLS estimates are consistent.

THe program put points on the screen continuously according to the DGP function. Meanwhile, the OLS estimators are calculated after each point is genereated. A fitted line is plotted on the screen.
